He complains to pain but no\ntriggering.\n\nI decided to obtain and review old records, including charts available in the EMR, in preparation for the\nvisit. A 10+ review of systems and PSFH is available in the patient record and relevant findings were\nincorporated into the histow of present illness. All other ROS systems are negative/noncontributory.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nHt 5‘11.5“ /\\/\\/t 237 lbs / BMI 32.6\n\nLEFT HAND AND WRIST EXAM\nInspection: Fingers are pink and well-perfused and no active triggering\nTenderness to Palpation: Tenderness over middle finger A1 pulley with palpable nodule and no\ntenderness over the sagittal bands ofthe middle finger MCP joint\nNeurovascular: Sensation intact to light touch throughout and brisk capillary refill\nStability:\nNo EDC subluxation\n\nIMAGING\n4/23/2020: Left hand x-ray at this clinic was ordered, taken, and reviewed by me. 3 views demonstrate no\n\nfractures or dislocations and well-aligned MCP joint of the left middle finger.\n\nASSESSMENT AN D PLAN\n\nOPD — PERMANENT RECORD\n\n",

I offered him a left middle finger\ntrigger digit injection. We discussed the risks and benefits of that. He desired to proceed and tolerated that\nwell. We‘re going to advance him to full duty. I‘m going to see him back in about 4-5 weeks for repeat\nexamination. N0 x-rays needed.\n\nFOLLOW-UP: 4-6 weeks or earlier if symptoms change, fail to improve, worsen, or if any additional\nquestions need to be answered.\n\nPROCEDU RE NOTES\n\nINJECTION NOTE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives of steroid injection therapy were discussed with\nthe patient. For the LEFT MIDDLE FINGER: Risks include (but are not limited to) blood sugar elevation,\ninfection, allergic reaction, bleeding, fat necrosis, hematoma formation and skin pigment changes. The\npatient understood and wished to continue. His allergies, past medical history, and medications were\nreviewed.\n\nThe steroid solution was drawn up which consisted of 1.5 cc of 6 mg/cc Celestone. The skin was prepped\nin the usual, sterile fashion using alcohol. The surrounding bony landmarks and the injection portal were\nidentified. The skin was then anesthetized with 1.5 cc Xylocaine. Using strict aseptic technique, the steroid\nsolution was then administered into the LEFT MIDDLE FINGER A1 pulley without significant resistance.\n\nHe tolerated the procedure well without complaints or apparent complications and the area was cleaned\nand dressed. Return precautions were provided and the patient voiced understanding. He had no further\nquestions or concerns.\n\nAny questions were answered. The patient demonstrated understanding and is agreeable with the\nrecommendations as discussed.\n\nWORKERS‘ COMPENSATION\n\nClaim Number: BLWC192572001\nDate of Injury (DOI): 04/21/2020\n\n",
